## Project Overview
This project showcases the strategy for expanding Zembo’s electric mobility solutions across Uganda, aiming to enhance sustainability, mobility,
and the reduction of CO2 emissions. Our team, **Boda-boda**, achieved **3rd place** in the **2024 Duke Business Case Competition** for 
**Energy in Emerging Markets**, competing among 70 international teams.

The project utilizes **Gurobi optimization models** to strategize the distribution of Zembo’s **solar-powered charging stations** and 
**franchise cabinets** to reach new cities in Uganda. The focus is on **B2B expansion**, including partnerships with **medicine delivery 
services**, and expanding Zembo's franchise model for **last-mile delivery**. This comprehensive approach ensures financial sustainability 
and scalability for Zembo's future growth.

## Features of the Project

- **Geographic Expansion**: Optimizes station placement using **Gurobi** and **GIS** software to cover new cities and expand Zembo’s reach in Uganda.
- **B2B Market Entry**: Targets partnerships with transportation operators and businesses that require efficient delivery solutions.
- **Franchise Model**: Provides a low-cost entry to franchise ownership, allowing individuals to operate battery-swapping stations with minimal upfront investment.
- **Financial Model**: Demonstrates positive cash flow from the first year, strong ROI, and long-term sustainability.
- **Community Impact**: Integrates **community empowerment** by offering business opportunities and promoting environmental sustainability.

## Key Results
- **Hackathon Achievement**: 3rd place at the **2024 Duke Business Case Competition** for **Energy in Emerging Markets**.
- **B2B Growth**: Developed strategies for business-to-business partnerships with companies like **DHL**, **FedEx**, and **Medsap Africa**.
- **Market Expansion**: Achieved projected growth reaching **over 877,000 people**, with **401km** covered by the network of stations.
- **Financial Performance**:
  - **Revenue**: Projected annual revenue of **$1,200,000** in 2024.
  - **Return on Investment (ROI)**: Achieved **190.64%** ROI by year 7 for internal expansion.
  - **Net Present Value (NPV)**: **$5.4 million** after 7 years, indicating strong future profitability.

## Methodology

1. **Growth Strategy**: Applied **Gurobi optimization** to expand Zembo’s presence in key cities based on population density and accessibility.
2. **Market Share Assumptions**: Calculated the **Total Available Market (TAM)**, **Serviceable Available Market (SAM)**, and **Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM)** based on electric mobility adoption rates in Uganda.
3. **Risk Management**: Addressed infrastructure limitations and competitive threats by incorporating **grid reliability backup** and **advanced security protocols**.

## Dataset Description

This project uses multiple datasets to evaluate the financial feasibility, assumptions, and key parameters for the Zembo electric mobility expansion. The datasets used are as follows:

1. **Different Scenarios (Different scenarios.xlsx)**:
   - This dataset contains various **financial assumptions** and **scenario-based estimations** for key factors like tax rates, B2B sales, and growth projections. It provides a range of values for different scenarios (Base, Pessimistic, Optimistic) to model potential outcomes for the Zembo expansion.

2. **Inventory Forecast (Inventory forecast.xlsx)**:
   - This dataset focuses on **cost assumptions** related to the ownership of batteries and operational assumptions for Zembo’s battery-swapping stations. It includes assumptions about inflation rates, energy usage, and other operational costs critical to assessing Zembo's long-term financial sustainability.

3. **Project Financial Analysis (Project financial analysis.xlsx)**:
   - This dataset provides **financial projections** for Zembo's expansion, including revenue, operating costs, and capital expenditures (CAPEX). It also includes important cost assumptions such as taxes, debt, and equity ratios, helping to estimate financial viability and future growth.

4. **Cashflow Values (Cashflows values.xlsx)**:
   - This dataset includes **cash flow projections** for Zembo’s various business models, outlining the expected net present value, net income and operational costs over a 7-year period.
